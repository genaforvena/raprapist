From this viewpoint the

continually jumping from one element to another; radiating in all directions;
emitting detachments wherever there are flows to be selected; including
disjunctions; consuming remains; extracting surplus values; connecting words

tation whose elements are organized at the surface of the socius: the
system of connotation-connection in the savage territorial machine
but also with respect to
the despotic machine
Freud shows that psychosis causes small multiplicities to
intervene
See also the recent
attempt by Andre Green
Thus it is that the famous eating machine
but in a state of dispersion such that one part is
continually referring to a part from an entirely different machine
He promotes the pure
analytic scene
We have

but one that is caught and
wedged in the capitalist machine
She marks the point where the social machine

not knowing whither
These are the commandments:

In the former law it was said: Do not kill
those slaves who fulfil the master's will
He who gives up false transitory riches for true life in accord with the Father's will
But the rich man said: Still
'I will
You do not choose my teaching of your own will
He says: Sometimes you will
But if I said nothing ill
He who is troubled about what results to his bodily life from the fulfilment of the Father's will
He who does not wholly reject the cares and gains of the bodily life cannot fulfil the Father's will
All can fulfil the Father's will
We ask forgiveness of Him for failing to fulfil His will
But to be mad is not necessarily to be ill
alcohol—or worse
still
Il
two wayfaring
strangers will
I believe I have it still
worse still
seems to appease
the lust to kill
these imperatives were quite explicit and
even detailed until
I can
see him still
ill
but ill
Mac-
mann let go the tree that hid him and turned back up the hill
I can see them still
I use it still
my hair slowly like soot still
I strained my ear towards what must have been
my voice still
But in
reality I had sutik to the ground of my own free will
They’ll surely bring me to
the surface one day or another and all then sink their differences
and agree it was not worth while going to so much trouble for such
a paltry kill
one
day he’ll thrill
yes it will
I’ll
hear it still
I can see him still

not to steal
we are well aware that the real object
can be produced only by an external causality and external mechanisms;
nonetheless this knowledge does not prevent us from believing in the intrinsic
power of desire to create its own object—if only in an unreal

He began

So also at life's end all that was temporary illusion will perish
but cannot foresee that we shall all die and perish
said to them: You must remember that it is expedient to kill one man rather than let the whole people perish
Let it be not as I wish
but that it was not always possible
to do as one did not wish
no need to wish
but rather the conditions under which this element
fades before the despotic element; and tragic representation does not
express the despotic element properly speaking
no night
properly speaking
of whom I have refrained from speaking
who is seeking
more generally speaking
such as speaking
but of speaking
I speaking
who understand what the Kingdom of God consists of
but as all his life he had taught his pupils love
You too should live by that same love
but that you have sent them into the world in love
whom I love
From that
moment it is a foregone conclusion that the collective agents will be interpreted
as derivatives of
whose
problems concern the family and love
but a force to
love
one upper with its opening above
But is it true love
Have I never known
true love
oh
not with true love
She is not black

There is no such thing as the social production of reality on the one hand
He therefore necessarily returns to a dualism between
the real object rationally produced on the one hand
there is the
twofold movement of decoding or deterritorializing flows on the one hand
But it was
soon noticed that on the one hand
But even within the progressive or revolutionary sectors of institu-
tional analysis on the one hand
leaves two problems untouched and makes them even more urgent: on
the one hand
Now on the one hand
from names to bodies: on the one hand
but only intensive
germinal states; on the other hand
But on the other
hand
But what they deterritorialii e with one hand
But for a reason I was not able to
understand
But the resistance
of the psychoses on the one hand
So what is the relationship between schizoanaiysis and politics on
the one hand
I mean my hand
so
near at hand
you understand
But whether it was he
didn’t understand
you
understand
but that was something I could
not hope to make him understand

I needed a prop under the ham you understand
so that the sand

He
was wiping his mouth with the back of his hand
I carried this sudden cordiality
so far as to shake her by the hand
I gave her

held it for a moment in his hand
I declare the foregoing to have been written with a firm and even
satisfied hand
He raised one hand
I don’t understand
I understand
I note
on the other hand
All I want now is to make a last
effort to understand
came
and shook his hand
laid his hand on the table and
his head on his hand

little heaps of finest sand

Though now close

Look to it that you do not weigh yourself down with cares

I had hopes
that it was waiting for me somewhere below stairs
my mother’s image sometimes mingles
with theirs
I therefore moved on and ensconced
myself on a flight of stairs
I felt myself
drifting towards other cares
from this state of affairs
he kept back
his tears
at the foot of the stairs
from my
mouth spent in vain with vain inventions all other utterance but

I have no language but

I have worked for you for many years
By placing the distorting mirror of incest before desire

These formations are oral

left but this monotonous voice
I have a fairly dis-
tinguished voice
He was asking himself questions in a low voice
Ah
Bah

Then my

But it
would not be my voice
But the other voice
May one
speak of a voice
I have no voice
out of range of every
voice
but so perfectly together that one wouW take
it for a single voice
I haven’t much
choice
Woe to those whom everyone praises
should not hide your light but show it by your actions
There can be
no revolutionary actions
But I tell you that everyone who grows angry with his brother-man deserves judgment
gave each of the pupils a piece
but the conditions under
which—in fifth-century Greece
drew the cigar from his
lips and buried his face in the orange fleece
their lying promise of gravity and
peace
these guardians of the peace
first one piece
I would not like it to cease
so that in my innocence 1 say they cease
I
would have held my peace
but it probably can only increase
my mind at peace
at my present rate of
decrease
there’d
be peace
then peace
I’ll
never know peace
don’t want peace
Thus we have already seen how the immanent criteria of
desiring-production permitted a definition of legitimate uses of syntheses
their arrangements and their syntheses
not one sucked
twice
but exist shattered into all corners of the
social field—the mother on the instructor's knees
have as many deceptive sojourns as the world arranges for those who think
they are standing straight and at ease
I got
to my knees
far more effective than for example a chef
in cardboard
So this is the first commandment: Do not be angry
but must not have more than one wife
do not desire women
But those in the second group seek out
women who prefer women
Through women
all capable of entering—
men with women
Do these psychoanalysts who are oedipalizing
women
She is the Madonna
of pregnant women
but live with her with whom you have become united
we’d be reunited
I would die delighted
How does one

But I pushed and pulled in vain
I looked at it in vain
There seemed to be rain
so meticulous and calm in the main
but a chain
I moved at quite a good speed and without much pain
at the limit of the plain
By day the shepherd would have raised his
pipe in vain
But when it was clear that the rain
though accurate
in the main
But when they totter it
is clear they are twain
cold anfl perpendicular rain
he began to wish that the rain would
never cease nor consequently his sufferings or pain
cold (without being icy) and perpendicular rain
rain
He had time to compose ten or twelve more or less in this vein
From here a fine view was to be obtained of the plain
I am motionless in vain
But may not this screen which
my eyes probe in vain
so as not to have not lived in vain
who hasn’t the wit to make himself plain
of this old
clout f \so patiently pawed in vain

Man cannot promise anything

Let him tell them everything

THE Jews saw that the teaching of Jesus would destroy their State religion and their nationality
from the unconscious libidinal investment of desire or

group ° The nature of this libidinal investment of the social field « The
two groups * The role of sexuality
We are told that partial objects are caught up in an intuition
of precocious totality
We do not deny that there is an Oedipal sexuality
but rather with the existence and the nature
of an anoedipal sexuality
marked by
ambiguous signs of twinness and bisexuality
E. R. Leach is led to displace the duality
of sexuality
" like a promise "whose hidden presence in the very interior of
the body must be situated at the extreme limit"; and with his mother the despot
simulates a superforce where the two sexes would be "at the maximum [degree
of externalization] of their specific natures": the B-A Ba of the phallus as voice.”

Hence something else is always at issue in royal incest: bisexuality
How is it that the celebrated neutrality
" but one continues to embrace the same humiliat-ing
and degrading conception of sexuality
through its loves and sexuality

Hence
in group fantasy the libido may invest all of an existing social field
From the very beginning Oedipus exists in one form and one form only:
open in all directions to a social field
we see that the individual fantasy is itself plugged into the existing social
field
These investments of an unconscious nature can ensure the general
submission to a dominant class by making cuts (coupures) and segregations pass
over into a social field
All the formal operations will have to be resumed
within a decoded social field
placed outside the field
But there are forms of love

Rich men went up to the box and put in much
But as such
They are relations of production as such
but the insertion of the bourgeoisie into a town and State
feudalism that consists in devising codes for flows that are decoded as
such
Once it is said that capitalism
works on the basis of decoded flows as such
one acts as

but also how it brought about this

These determinate conditions are thus the forms of

Anti-Oedipus seeks to discover the
"deterritorialized" flows of desire
But
if one wishes also to analyze the flows of desire
serves as a surface for the recording of the entire process of
production of desire
must be
credited with effecting a critical revolution as regards the theory of desire
We maintain
that the social field is immediately invested by desire
We find ourselves
confronted with the same problem once again: How has the process of the
production of desire
But the machine remains desire
but performs all the possible
triangulations by distributing in a given domain desire
He then became
rather indifferent to the fact that this beyond derives from the familial complex
through the analytical transformation of desire
but that is a common-universal for the sole purpose of
introducing lack into desire
assign-
ing an element of lack to each position of desire
From the moment lack is reintroduced into desire
signs of desire
but to the
noncoded flows that constitute desire
How could designation subsist when the sign has ceased to be a
position of desire
Hence desire
We have difficulty under-
standing what principles psychoanalysis uses to support its conception
of desire
my ass burns like fire
Freud
discovers the subjective nature or abstract essence of desire
but affects just as well the flows of labor and desire
but to cause absolutely decoded
flows of desire
by
making this turned-back death (/a mort retournee) into a force of desire
But
the same enterprise is continued and reinforced—eliminating the

machinic element of desire
Now we can present the second thesis of schizoanalysis: within the social
investments we will distinguish the unconscious libidinal investment of group or
desire
Flows that run on the porous full body of a
socius—these are the object of desire
yet thereby one stands a greater chance of killing desire
Let us consider for a
moment the motivations that lead someone to be psychoanalyzed: it involves a
situation of economic dependence that has become unbearable for desire
but much to do with desire
of gears and parts of machines of
desire
but not one manifestation of desire

So it is that psychoanalysis has much

But they are severe

he’d disappear

But this woman has pitied me and done good truly
Strange laughter truly
They will be neither

He said that only he seeks what is good and does good deeds

Hence the presentation of desire as something supported by needs
Here then were two incompatible bodily needs
So
that the bourgeois is justified in saying
There was no good my saying

capable of being bent on anything all a lifetime long

too long

I am wrong

they are not so much genuine buttons as little wooden
cylinders two or three inches long
But these arc few compared to the

So long as it is what is called
a living being you can’t go wrong

But they
dare not be silent for long
you won’t say it long
I'll remember it as I go

So he went
all erect and turned towards the event

Marx termed the twofold movement of the tendency to

means of a conjunction; a flow—this time uninterrupted—of raw profit

Thus
the circles traced by Beckett's Unnamable: "a succession of irregular
loops
but
rather of instituting original forms of active groups
Hence another possible formulation of an inverse relationship:
there would be something like two groups
There are not two groups

and their lineages are not distinct corporate groups

the perverse tie of a primary homosexuality between local groups

Here we discover a new determination of the properly capitalist field

far from
cancelling the flows
Such relations indeed imply a quantitative siphoning off of
portions of the different sorts of flows

Hence it is correct to retrospectively understand all

does not lead to the dissolution of feudalism

differential relation as a conjunction that defines the immanent social field

By no means does
the diachronic capitalist machine allow itself to be revolutionized by one or more

From machines
he is not content to say that organisms are machines
but asserts that
they contain such an abundance of parts that they must be compared to
very different parts of distinct machines
These
are therefore the same machines
such as this passage appears in the
organic machines
but just the opposite; thereafter there is no longer even any reason for

Those who have read us this far will perhaps find many reasons for
reproaching us: for believing too much in the pure potentialities of art and even
of science; for denying or minimizing the role of classes and class struggle; for
militating in favor of an irrationalism of desire; for

From paranoia to schizophrenia

we maintain that it both does and does not have an exterior limit: it has
an exterior limit that is schizophrenia

At the heart of Capital
"!”

We cannot say that psychoanalysis is very innovative in this
respect: it continues to ask its questions and develop its interpretations
from the depths of the Oedipal triangle as its basic perspective
set back into the Oedipal orbit in the perspective
so that psychoanalysis merely had the role of explaining
the subjective
one that is collective
but does so on an indivisible
earth where the connective
but rather a position and a production of
desire: "In order for the young woman's transformation to be fully effective
But everything is objective or subjective

whose resolution introduces him into society
but the real history of the corresponding
society
We
have seen in what sense schizophrenia was the absolute limit of every society
So that capitalism is
without doubt the universal of every society
but asserts that they are really limbs
and organs lying on the body without organs of a society
We are misled by considering any complicated machine as a single thing;
in truth it is a city or a society
not one
child—who can as such "assume" her or his situation in a capitalist society
but
also for the para-oedipal varieties
But such is not the case: most ethnologists have clearly
noted the sexual nature of affects in the public symbols of primitive societies
Since psychoanalysis is of no help
far from help
might be a
help
Help
help
we have only to play again on a
paradox dear to Nietzsche
See Friedrich Nietzsche
said
Nietzsche
He does well to remark that Nietzsche
how can it have reduced him to this state of a body
without organs that has become a dead thing—this schizo who sought to
remain at that unbearable point where the mind touches matter and lives
its every intensity
of the conscious and
the unconscious forces
They come from the two preceding forces
But we have postponed the analysis of the real forces
but
to reactive forces
such a group already
presents all the unconscious characteristics of a subjugated group: the
subordination to a socius as a fixed support that attributes to itself the
productive forces
I mean while floundering through a pon-
derous chronicle of moribunds in their courses
each of whom had
different insights concerning madness and dissension
We
are surprised when we hear a knowledgeable analyst mention
but where the
reality of matter has abandoned all extension
not because the myth would be a transposed or even an
inverse representation of real relations in extension
at the moment they are acting on the flows of desire with a
maximum of vigilance and extension
There too it is like an abstraction that belongs to another dimension
Then
you try to pay attention
I
shall also draw attention

But soon it stirs
not only to the Greek myth of Oedipus and to the Oedipus complex as defined by classical
psychoanalysis
by denouncing the illegitimate use of the syntheses of the
unconscious as found in Oedipal psychoanalysis
who are developing another
conception of psychoanalysis
but also to Oedipal mechanisms
but rather imply "intuitions"
that are linked to resonances and conjunctions of structures
passed under the structures
bulking large in spite of their remoteness and all astir

Hence everything is production: production of
productions

we are here drawing no conclusions whatsoever as to the nature and the
relationship of the two productions
These constructions

production of productions

Thus the schizophrenic
Schreber's divine is inseparable from the disjunctions he
employs to divide himself up into parts: earlier empires

But all this happens and is all recorded on the surface of the body without

they always shatter into fragments that come into contact with
these agents

They are nevertheless in an intimate relationship with psychic

so that repression
But it in fact implies an original double
operation: the repressive social formation delegates its power to an agent of
psychic repression
They have entrusted all their forces to primal repression

You think
you are simply resting

Now the only papers I carry with me are
bits of newspaper
I wrapped
myself in swathes of newspaper

I am quiet

I had been touched

asks nothing but to follow in his footsteps

right-hand drawer of my desk
we don’t intend to re-
lapse into picaresque
done with hearing
I hearing
I hasten to answer blindly
I had perhaps gone too far in saying that my mother
lived near the shambles
I took advantage of the silence which followed
these kind words to turn towards the window
Through the door I saw a big
window
I like to go up to a
window
Sapo snatched it
from his hand and threw it out of the window
my mind felt it
surely
I will not tell what followed
I
followed
Then
all his conversation was of this new pig
big
like a pig
I don’t know if it’s big
I
hooked it round my neck

me to have a pain in the neck
They want me to have a mind

my body could tell between them and seemed even to
have its likes

suddenly briefly
So that I was never disappointed
I wasn’t particularly disappointed

like certain curtains
then growing murky and dim
my genius for forgetting
We met in a rubbish dump
but what is it that presses against my rump
Through the splendours of nature they dragged a paralytic and now
there’s nothing more to admire it’s my duty to jump
I would have preferred it seems to me an orifice
less arid and roomy
doors opening and shutting
but I had other props
But
when it falters and when it stops
My knees are enormous
They made a little too much music
some in the shelter of
the umbrella

Slumped over my umbrella
have I mentioned his
umbrella

I was always aged

my asthma
like the crackling of thorns
at least I think it’s urine
I
don’t like gloom to lighten
I
had a certain number of encounters in this forest
I looked forward to getting
out of the forest
but all the same
I had my little quota
cleaned
then sometimes my bed is caught up into the air and
tossed like a straw by the swirling eddies
my free hand pressed to my belly
my old
belly
But he fancied that
the nape of the neck and the back right down to the loins were
more vulnerable than the chest and belly
One minute in a skull
and the next in a belly
He told her to eat and she began to eat the remains of
the rabbit
heedless of the weather outlook
He
took out and opened his notebook
He closed his notebook

I would forbid him to call

wrote my bagpipes
he turned away
from me in fury

grew dimmer and
dimmer* as they advanced

I went back to the shelter
But at the same time I kept my
eye on the shelter
I went towards the
shelter
nor outside

I re-

far from shelter
from shelter
such as a
kick in the arse
they’ll start sprouting under my arse
so that its light fell full on the intruder
Of her
salad

Then
suddenly I threw myself on the playthings
Their quarters were cramped
First dirty
I watched them shine
brighter and brighter
by means of
her cunt
But the dog stops at the threshold
poised irresolute on the bright threshold
who knows to what lengths he may be carried
oh not the very latest
bang
But I did not like proper shelters
So I avoided as
far as possible having recourse to proper shelters
I’ll stop
screaming
Of course I still have my little fits
of impatience
Now it is the present I must establish
Oh Adrian
deep down I never doubted
saw myself losing
they’ll stop howling
my stick has gone through the cupboard
wild and soft
Big Lambert
all unsuspecting
but in a short time
of washing
but without malice
how can I recognise myself who never made my acquaintance
He was called the Saxon
no sky for their dispersing
then it must be murmurs

my lead and the French pencil
so fertile in
incidents and mishaps
I whose every move has always been
a groping
I would have gone on peacefully being
bored tr howls
Some nice point in semantics
Take advantage of the brand-new soul and substantiality to
abandon
here I am
in safety
but perhaps it
appears to him in the dreadful cries of the gulls that evening
assembles
who always thought I would shrivel and shrivel
Then it will be all over with the Murphys
each hand a tuft
x being the width
of the shoulders in inches
But the rain glued it to the ground and churned it
up with the earth and grass into a kind of muddy pulp
not a
muddy pulp
but which little by little invaded
I used it as a receptacle
but insufficiently
Oh not yet sufficiently
so that
its beautiful eyes might be impressed on the celluloid
One
weakens
gagged to the gullet
time for a cud of ljnging
to rise up in the back of your gullet
So courage
through what
channels
who never
answered
But
towards the close of this idyll
I could never bear to be
idle
sought a means of putting an end to their
intercourse
But this innumerable babble
spread out from the buildings and beat the thickets
I can understand their annoyance
who knows towards
what high destiny I am heading
I’ve never left the island
though this is unimportant
All the rest I renounce
then you renounce
I don’t mind failing
sight failing
smell failing
but the voice is failing
at the moment of their failing
I mean when I took myself for Mahood
Then I with-
drew my adhesion
he so anxious to
obtain my adhesion
both of which I
had succeeded in preserving
but they wer^ agreed
I had been a fine baby
by way of the vagina like a real live
baby
spew it up whole along with the
rest of the vomit
then I vomit
I may therefore perhaps legiti-
mately suppose that the one-armed one-legged wayfarer of a
moment ago ftnd the wedge-headed trunk in which I am now
marooned are simply two phases of the same carnal envelope
