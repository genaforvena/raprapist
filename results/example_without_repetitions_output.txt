some in the shelter of
the umbrella
Flat on my belly
I had stolen from Lousse
a little silver
I called
from his good collection properly so-called
There is rapture
I never escaped
all that is needed is to wander and let wander
but vanish
raise
their heads
Day is the time for lynching

their elders
sweat and trembling
I wondered
half sleeping
I’ll sec fingers
by an extraordinary hazard
not haphazard
but dimly
urged on* by the cries and laughter of her
companions
but I say my pots
I was always aged
at the gates of their metropolis
though of the same
family exactly
by using the former exclusively
he suffers as
he has always suffered
these giant fronds
they call that bonds
quite plainly and frankly
my asthma
like the crackling of thorns
at least I think it’s urine
I
don’t like gloom to lighten
I
had a certain number of encounters in this forest
but all the same
I had my little quota
cleaned
then sometimes my bed is caught up into the air and
tossed like a straw by the swirling eddies
He told her to eat and she began to eat the remains of
the rabbit
heedless of the weather outlook
He
took out and opened his notebook
no battery
Yes papa
I have listened at different hours of the day and night and never
heard anything suspicious or unusual
Damp
She sat down
by the window and turned down the wick of the lamp

so disposed as to lead the eyes gently to the camp
But he’s a very good
dentist
My son
had two albums
through the railings
I must have missed my
point of purchase
now that it’s irrevocable
now beacon
dead without knowing it to the meaning of one’s instructions
and incapable of remembering them for more than a few seconds
they are in the plural
They are numerous
their long lamps

THE UNNAMABLE

baby’s bladder from bursting
bulk
first murky
I have always
had great success with my turkeys
I was not
going to expose myself to thunderbolts which might be fatal
He struggled
those that merge
yep
torn from their melan-
choly thoughts
I nearly
wrote my bagpipes
I advanced
my birds of which the least is known to
me and the way all its own it has of singing
I know
scarcely any better where I am going and what awaits me than the
night I ".lung to the wicket
dear charnel-house
of renegades
I who am so good at
topography
though in terms if necessary veiled
Ten shillings
my teeth
clenched
Stretched out in the
shelter
such as a
kick in the arse
so that its light fell full on the intruder
Of her
salad
said Lady Pedal
Then
suddenly I threw myself on the playthings
Their quarters were cramped
I watched them shine
brighter and brighter
by means of
her cunt
But the dog stops at the threshold
who knows to what lengths he may be carried
oh not the very latest
bang
But I did not like proper shelters
I’ll stop
screaming
Of course I still have my little fits
of impatience
Now it is the present I must establish
Oh Adrian
deep down I never doubted
saw myself losing
they’ll stop howling
my stick has gone through the cupboard
wild and soft
Big Lambert
all unsuspecting
but in a short time
of washing
but without malice
how can I recognise myself who never made my acquaintance
He was called the Saxon
no sky for their dispersing
then it must be murmurs
wc must have eyelids
My pencil
so fertile in
incidents and mishaps
I whose every move has always been
a groping
I would have gone on peacefully being
bored tr howls
Some nice point in semantics
Take advantage of the brand-new soul and substantiality to
abandon
here I am
in safety
but perhaps it
appears to him in the dreadful cries of the gulls that evening
assembles
who always thought I would shrivel and shrivel
Then it will be all over with the Murphys
each hand a tuft
x being the width
of the shoulders in inches
But the rain glued it to the ground and churned it
up with the earth and grass into a kind of muddy pulp
but which little by little invaded
I used it as a receptacle
but insufficiently
Oh not yet sufficiently
so that
its beautiful eyes might be impressed on the celluloid
One
weakens
gagged to the gullet
So courage
through what
channels
who never
answered
But
towards the close of this idyll
I could never bear to be
idle
sought a means of putting an end to their
intercourse
But this innumerable babble
spread out from the buildings and beat the thickets
I can understand their annoyance
who knows towards
what high destiny I am heading
I’ve never left the island
though this is unimportant
All the rest I renounce
I don’t mind failing
I mean when I took myself for Mahood
Then I with-
drew my adhesion
both of which I
had succeeded in preserving
but they wer^ agreed
I had been a fine baby
spew it up whole along with the
rest of the vomit
I may therefore perhaps legiti-
mately suppose that the one-armed one-legged wayfarer of a
moment ago ftnd the wedge-headed trunk in which I am now
marooned are simply two phases of the same carnal envelope
Slough
off this mortal inertia
like those I have been asking
I’ll have my bellyful of
mammals
He
weeps
we’re
piled* up in heaps
song and dance
of thanksgiving by victim
but at length
then louder
look at the daisies
I
say 1 sec noting
I think I must have blackouts
look
at this photograph
all is painless
till I’m tempted
one ifiustn’t be
afraid of making a howler
you didn’t notice
nor be dextrous
I know millions
