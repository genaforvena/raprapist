Now the intention is dead
I want none of your lip
drove all the cattle out of the porch
He put out his torch
turned out all the doves
he called the slaves to whom he had given the money
So I 
will only add that the mornings were often sunny
do not oppress a stranger
oh therms no danger
do not shed innocent blood
you hear the long kiss of dead water and mud
like being crucified
But in order to blacken a few more pages 
may I say I spent some time at the seaside
I reflected with bitter satisfaction that if my son lay down and 
died by the wayside
You cannot teach me divine things
their heads under 
their wings
swings
mad old 
woman
but Jesus only teaches
Then the seat 
of my breeches
But sucking-stones abound on our beaches
He who speaks of the earth is of the earth
I know 
the year of my birth
They had left the town
played the clown
trapped
Then Jesus said: There were two men who held themselves debtors to one master
I shall go faster
So I am not 
heading for disaster
He read

each in its own stead
I w <t s forgetting the lead
I’ll call

I feel less weak
I confuse east and west

At all 
events the more she declined the more Macmann longed to crush 
her to his breast
then a kind 
of frenzy seized upon him and he began to belabor with his fists 
his chest
they are not obliged to make them- 
selves manifest
Then some pupils of John came to Jesus and said: Why do your pupils not fast
Then a Jewish Levite passed
from my first steps until my 
last
But 
the place where he lies is vast
so as to have both hands free to hold 
on to my son by the waist
like brass
Do not be downcast
Have you come fasting
at this punc- 
tual image of the countenance everlasting
He said: When you went to John in the wilderness to be baptized
I seemed 
to have surprised
I had for a time the impression he was disguised
Those Orthodox teachers of the law only consider true what they themselves invent and hear from one another
So I saw A and C going slowly towards each other
I mean to my mother
I acted in a word precisely as one does
They were watching me through the

They said that God would come with divers visible signs

I don’t know what that means

voured at five o’clock I was left with only two tins of sardines
But by taking a little pains
I seemed 
to hear
These words struck 
it is not too much to say as clearly on my ear
though it lit the chandelier
Some came near
But Judas was a thief and a liar
I came to ask you a favour
I could do with 
another beer
you can always find an old lace
But I lent myself to it with a good enough grace
She 
would have served us dinner in any case
they have left no 
discernible trace
I who never 
missed mass
lit up a little space
broad 
at the base
stuck up to his skull in his vase
I 
knew he was given to prolonged fasts
born of the flesh and grown up
back to this foul little den all dirty white and 
vaulted
Not for man's destruction
I easily managed fifteen
blind and lean
I was fourteen
far from cleansing him of his sin
But when they totter it 
is clear they are twain
not knowing whither
These are the commandments:

In the former law it was said: Do not kill
those slaves who fulfil the master's will
But the rich man said: Still
But if I said nothing ill
these imperatives were quite explicit and 
even detailed until
Mac- 
mann let go the tree that hid him and turned back up the hill
one 
day he’ll thrill
Well supplied with pain-killers I drew upon them 
freely
not to steal
But I think she spied on me a great 
deal
long enough to feel
like a sower
dis- 
pleased at seeing me sink lower and lower
but also for the sum of all cycles
sprouts
He 
was in the scouts
full of doubts
roots
stalk
they got in my way when I tried to walk
Say four o’clock
He began 
to talk
but 
the youth had thrown himrelf down in the shade of a rock
So also at life's end all that was temporary illusion will perish
Let it be not as I wish
no night 
properly speaking
who is seeking
who understand what the Kingdom of God consists of
but as all his life he had taught his pupils love
one upper with its opening above
I mean my hand
you land
spread on the sand
so that the sand 
ran through my fingers and fell back on the strand
take their stand
But let 
us go back as planned
bend- 
ing and unbending at the word of command
none to demand
So I speak these parables with two meanings
All the things you would do gladly
But I had turned my phrase 
badly
he had paid his few coppers to climb
'for thine is the kingdom
who reminded them that the garden was not theirs
Look to it that you do not weigh yourself down with cares
life without tears
I had hopes 
that it was waiting for me somewhere below stairs
from this state of affairs
who hears
I have worked for you for many years
I don’t know what I wanted
Now they rejoice
at your choice
Till nothing was 
left but this monotonous voice
should not hide your light but show it by your actions
But I tell you that everyone who grows angry with his brother-man deserves judgment
drew the cigar from his 
lips and buried his face in the orange fleece
I would not like it to cease
but it probably can only increase
at my present rate of 
decrease
would not a little stir suffice
I have a huge bunch of keys
I wish to say that I 
often thought of my bees
But no definite disease
far more effective than for example a chef 
in cardboard
So this is the first commandment: Do not be angry
do not desire women
but live with her with whom you have become united
we’d be reunited
I would die delighted
He had time to compose ten or twelve more or less in this vein
had fallen
I should have avoided this 
bright stain
he dies in the train
do not call upon God when lying
half sighing
their song sadly dying
of flying
There is no use denying
no use 
trying
Man cannot promise anything
Let him tell them everything
But the vassal begged mercy of the king
my head docs
Up on the box
like the echo that mocks
seized my axe
they are a better proposition 
than ducks
know what 
smokes
he need onlv relax
True life is like a feast a rich man gave
Think of the doctor’s fees we save
Wood and tears 
and skin and bones and the tossing in the grave
You cannot judge
not a budge

All men are His children

Then the blaze
You try to drive out evil by threats
I will secretly give away some of my master's goods to the peasants and reduce their debts
They can do nothing to your souls
no regrets
Squeeze
They are too hard to please
my sufferings 
cease and I end
I could have put up with him as a friend
we don’t intend
out of this

I have my faults
Thanks I suppose
All your teachings of the law of Moses are false
But you should not do so; if you suffer want
from his place beside the font
untfl there is no room

I resume
nor of whom
We took 
the little side streets
I opened my trousers and I

not to lust
All that

Look on God's creatures
But these self-styled teachers
But within
Ah if they could only begin
at a pinch
not in the past or in the future
Ask
Thanks then to this poor old 
man I have been spared a painful task
then let it come: but in the suffering I want one thing only
From the burdock you do not gather grapes
shapes
struck with violence
I mean given to resolutions
but 
diminishing together as it were in ratio
but high enough
may not end in darkness
nor is his voice raised
who has revealed what was hidden from the wise and learned to the simple
I pursued
their thoughts wander as they call on Jude
I conclude
There was then a bathing-place in the city
More’s the pity
Oh I don’t say I wipe myself every time I have a stool
not too cruel
like the inhabitants of Blackpool
but 
trouble
Bent double
stumb- 
ling through the rubble
built by volunteers
by going away or 
stopping your ears
fears
each enclosed within its own frontiers
Then the elder brother came from the field
smiled
I finally decided that to go back on my decision
But the father did not even listen
But it is not a sound like the other sounds
I gave him five pounds
but of the towns
by its ups and downs
one to each
one 
leg hooked up under her breech
no beach
at being bereft of speech
no matter what their 
burden
I do not consider you as slaves to whom orders are given
But the master said: Give to him who worked much
We are all such
They have time to do so while being taken out of the hutch
I would identify them by touch
you push them into the dust-pan 
with the brush
lad
Go mad
He who follows me will not hunger
There she would call Hannah
though I am not all-powerful in the body
He who does not accept my teaching is accused
But my ideas on this 
subject were always horribly confused
I had refused
Those of course were not the words he used
not to take oaths
She had no time to lose
he would not sleep
They are 
deep
I had only to find them again 
and I would sweep
I must have 
fallen asleep
but old leaves 
that have known the long joys of summer and now are good for 
nothing kut to lie rotting in a heap
long and steep
But do not be afraid when you are taken to the Courts
my sorts
who drops his sweep under cover of night and crawls be- 
tween the thwarts
He too had dug holes
my soles
stretched palely between the last boles
those activities which in the course of my inter- 
minable existence have given me only a mild pain in the balls
my skull 
all cracked and furrowed and on fire
I hear a choir
both front and rear
faint and clear
one forgets
Now they all give me the shits
They teach men that their God will be pleased by external rites
I shall not call you bike
They looked alike
so quite unlike
he has told me what he 
is like
Each of you should first reckon all that he considers his own: family
I arrive
I gave 
you five
But away from the hive
I wonder if 
I could not contrive
You too will grieve
She had a sister
I mean one of a nature 
to carry
But they finally remarked that he hid
But 
God forbid
but only to pretend that it was a just trial
all that is not worth while
squeal
But does he in fact wheel
far from containing my boot
still and mute
But if there is wind from the south
He clicked his tongue against the roof 
of his mouth
How is it that we can tell the weather
feet pressed 
together
I shall soon lose consciousness altogether
shall receive a hundredfold more than sisters
Then it 
would be a life worth having
They said: He is an evil doer
then rapidly bigger and bigger
He said: If you are invited to a dinner
went into the 
yard and began hacking madly at an old chopping-block that lay 
there and on which in winter
I believe I have entered on the season of increase 
and plenty
He has caused me loss
I who 
came before the cross
God does not look at the exterior
No sound save the oars
by the shores
floors
he 
goes to the wars
I think I shall be able to tell myself four stories
Let them scourge me without ceasing and evermore
but then you shall ask what you will and it will all be yours
But soon it stirs
they would 
contrive things in such a way that I couldn’t suspect the two 
vessels
You say of yourselves that you are sons of Abraham

but Lazarus only had sorrow

to the silence that it breaks and whence perhaps one day will

four knocks on her skull

Ah I was a precocious child

But Mary took a pound of fresh scented oil
Here and there faint movements of recoil

him be of good cheer
But they are severe
he’d disappear
Such were my thoughts as I waited for my son to come back 
and Gaber
But this woman has pitied me and done good truly
They will be neither 
beautiful nor ugly
He said that only he seeks what is good and does good deeds
Here then were two incompatible bodily needs
There was no good my saying
Go you to the feast
far in the east
two or three feet off the ground at least
But what was not to be expected was 
the speed at which their weakness had increased
he finds 
himself saddled with a wife long since deceased
like such a beast
You say that our service is wrong
all the short summer night long
But these arc few compared to the 
solitaries pressing forward through the throng
Come along
Then the master sent
came and 
went
I wondered if I might not relent
T am con- 
tent
all erect and turned towards the event
spent
my legs raised and bent
of cement
but not to that extent
no convictions
But you ask of me proofs
faint at first
So I will merely observe 
that finally in his turn the constable too dispersed
Now the case is reversed
with- 
out having to fear the worst
said to the chief priests: A man should not be condemned without being heard
But just then the feast of the Passover occurred
But Jesus was still silent and said not another word
But then it had only attacked 
me once and never recurred
like a bird
I’ll die in the lower third
I haven’t stirred
free of all meaning
then over on their 
fleecy sides
We must have the 
heavens and God knows what besides
They said to him: We are not bastards
One day we were walking along the 
road
But this is a refine- 
ment of feeling which can hardly be attributed to the dogs that 
come jessing against my abode
We shall turn our backs

He is of age

turned over 
the pagwS till he came to the right page
like a caged beast born of caged beasts born of

He replied: I have told you already
So be always ready
He has killed Teddy
Keep 
her steady
They began to revile him and said: You are his pupil
no humour for the living

Like Job
how can other sons of the same father be envious of his joy
but makes an altogether different noise
but tell us simply and plainly whether you are the Messiah
like a verse of Isaiah

on the earth as on a chessboard; coldly hatching my plans
John and James
Of these two names
He ought to play more games

I am still obeying orders
I would help in the garden
I beg 
your pardon
See how much has to be sacrificed

since I could not do otherwise
there is net

There I am launched again on the same old hopeless business
But the foolish ones had forgotten that it was important not only that the lights should burn
But instead of 
grovelling in my turn
then the anguish of return
I think 
I have nothing to learn
So that I half discern
Six excursion soups
but a suc- 
cession of irregular loops
clothed the naked
There is no doubt one sometimes 
meets with strangers who are not entire strangers
They are better than anyone
there must be someone

give myself the shape
my mouth agape
make my escape

stable fugitive thing

I began to swing
then the keys and last the ring
wring
were it only that of a little bird alighting or 
taking to wing
by a string
since to me too I must attribute a begin- 
ning
then sadly resume 
their labour
She had been to see a neighbour
He was beaten
I would stick out my nose
one with toes

God knows
I pass 
judgement on it and on those
noes
No matter where he goes
death 
throes
flows
no repose
not a word of the stories it spews
but Christ is that same Lord
then clearly any sacrifice they make for others will seem to them an act worthy of reward
I will go further and declare that if I were obliged to record
not to mention the expense 
which I am ill able to afford
through the 
channel of its innumerable authorities speaking with one accord
' I implored

My hard collars
there is no mercy
They outwardly honour the holy martyrs

I think the dawn was not so slow in coming as I had 
feared
gave the finishing blow to this 
get-up which otherwise might have appeared
no beard
now it’s 
the seashore
five commandments must be obeyed:

The first commandment is to do no ill to anyone so as not to arouse anger
I like to think ^occupy the centre
But a time will come when all their churches and all external worship of God will be destroyed
so 
that the subject falls far from the verb and the object lands 
somewhere in the void
he goes in and sits down at the table
of not being able
I smell the stable
so that they did not know of whom he spoke
Smoke
Choke

let’s drive 
on now to the end of the joke
broke it into twelve pieces
still green in places
from the familiar faces
girt himself with a towel
No* matter
from the former to the latter
You’ll do that later
But perhaps I was mistaken
but stern measures were simply taken
fished up from 
the bottom of the bucket one after another the six pieces of bacon
But let me complete my views
but it’s 
the word I mean to use
I pass on the news
you don’t know whose
goose
He who lives according to my teaching shall have all that he desires
They saw my life and my life showed them their error
I tell you this beforehand
So I went back inland
I have never 
been able to conceive
Now I am willing to believe
whom I had not yet heard leave
you will receive

we have 
even piano-tuners up our sleeve
they know there is no worse torment
but when it is over she does not remember the suffering
I would as it were take the 
place of the dog I had killed
But the principal beauty of this region was a kind of strangled 
creek which the slow grey tides emptied and filled
they have been stilled
these the kind of clear and 
simple notions on which it is possible for me to build
Then Pilate again began to question Jesus in the presence of the chief priests
There is the temptation of the scribes
But they said to him: If you release Jesus you will show yourself a disloyal servant to Caesar
But the chief priests insisted
Then Pilate remembered that Galilee was under the jurisdiction of King Herod

Yet another condition of the agreement related to rules for washing and purifying
These I amused myself with identifying
All external worship is unnecessary
I saw

He attended his classes with 
his mind elsewhere
I know it’s there

I am not heading anywhere
You see them crawling and fluttering in the warm 
corners
He said: Men's lives
Some of them worked
Know this in advance: in despite of persecution
Then they gave him a cross to carry and led him to the place of execution

All has proceeded
you think you have succeeded
He must not only not plan his life according to his own wishes
I’ve two surfaces and no thickness

But some of those invited were busy with trading
not that man should delight himself with woman's charms
took the little creature in his arms
but as that is impossible
How then can we fail to seek to quench evil as quickly as possible
He often complained of his 
health
I saw it lift
Now that we

But my fingers

pages and turns them without my knowing

They too 
are unhappy

I know it was warm again the day I left

But the collar has remained intact

But these stations were short-lived
Men are tempted to infringe the second commandment by thinking of woman as created for bodily pleasure
Men are tempted to infringe the third commandment by creating
I might just happen to be masturbating
I if I once

He who recognizes his life as being in the will of the Father cannot bind his actions by pledges
But then these hedges
There is the temptation of authority
I gave thanks for evening that

But I

But a little animation now for pity’s sake

But in that case surely 
our testicles would have collided
Then the officer of the soldiers ordered Jesus to be bound and taken to Annas
one could see the peels of oranges and bananas
So having condemned Jesus in their court
But if I was in the habit of first settling this delicate 
question of transport
He asked for a report
Long or short
Then I counted by fifteens
So many 
pages
But in the early stages
I began at the beginning
saw myself winning
Let me tell you something
then I think it’ll be over
Then 
you try to pay attention
smooth or rough
breathe out the bloody stuff
though tolerated apparently by the ass
Oh God grant he pass
But 
the wall was unbroken and smooth and topped uniterruptedly 
with broken glass
you even see grass
like gas
I mean without hedges or ditches or any kind of edge
Lousse her- 
self I saw but little
sense what course to 
follow
But perhaps at the sound of their steps
Some days I advanced 
no more than thirty or forty paces
I stopped
like a puppet when its strings are 
dropped
so as to know him better
but I heard a murmur
but I had to do my utmost
damn the almost
I was sick
I put my hand on the stick
thick
but I had to say something 
quick
tom its wick
night was gathering
isn’t exactly a 
landmark
my sweet old hairy Mac
I saw him only darkly
but most of all I think 
because of other things calling me and towards which too one after 
the other my soul was straining
there was always talk of 
draining
I mustn’t start complaining
of course
Then you see 
the last stage of the horse
whom I might resemble
I don’t remember
my so-called virile 
member
made of bright and black
of stopping
done with parting
from compassion or because you have long been 
straying with no other company than the endless roads
but here there are no loads
crouched on the sand in the lee of the rocks with the smell 
of the seaweed and the wet rock and the howling of the wind the 
waves whipping me with foam or sighing on the beach softly 
clawing the shingle
I must have been on the top
I waited until the last drop

So he had only

He liked 
sums
I know it’s my only chance to — my 
only chance
Much 
of my life has ebbed away before this shivering expanse
I knew only in advance
oh not as men dance

Such operations took on a multitude of forms

Once I touched with my 
lips
old ladies often break their hips
all shame 
drunk
like a Carthusian monk
their heads sunk
deep down in my trunk
Thus we 
cleared these difficult straits
waits
I’m used to that question
You think 
you are simply resting
my arms on the handlebars
their tongues hanging out for order
Now the only papers I carry with me are 
bits of newspaper
So quiet
light diet
I had been touched
at the school he at- 
tended
But when the rain descended
my pensum ended
who 
asks nothing but to follow in his footsteps
were savouring its languid ending
there 
is no good pretending
out of the second 
right-hand drawer of my desk
we don’t intend to re- 
lapse into picaresque
left increasingly to be desired
But I was tired
I 
must simply be on my guard
Then having kissed all 
round and wished one another happy dreams they retired
not being hard of hearing
bulking large in spite of their remoteness and all astir 
with little dots or flecks forever appearing and disappearing
I hasten to answer blindly
but thought 
he had done as any man of good will would have done in his 
place and with very much the same results
But they have only to be a little gentle
were not to rid them of all that 
was not lentil
Then they stay in their kennel
I look 
forward to their giving me great satisfaction
Now the sergeant
I had perhaps gone too far in saying that my mother 
lived near the shambles
I took advantage of the silence which followed 
these kind words to turn towards the window
I mean that on reflection
But there was kind'ed no new seat of suffering or 
infection
at their points of intersection
1 should neverthe- 
less have established a kind of connection
so long as you go to mass and contribute to the collection
But in the other direction
I’ll make the correction
But these were small things compared to the change in 
her complexion
I have no objection
Now my sick leg
of an egg
you take refuge in the horizontal
my mind felt it 
surely
all of a sudden
there you have Molloy
thank you lady
I will not tell what followed
but a wall gave way and I filled with 
roots and tame stems for example
I had it to overflowing
Then 
all his conversation was of this new pig
big
go through the motions
I cannot read the stars
Three hundred and fifteen farts in nine- 
teen hours
round and 
smooth
of those 
who know the sun and moon emerge at such an hour and at 
such another plunge again below the surface
They remind me of an old ship- 
wreck
He ate and drank
Round the shank
I put my foot to the ground the better to see the

approaching barge
but always the peaceful 
sounds of men at large
food and lodging such as they were free of all 
charge
I have a pensum 
to discharge
took a few puffs
But I will listen no longer
but I would not hurt any- 
one’s feelings
But 
I find the morning
My little finger glides before my pencil 
across the page and gives warning
I mean it was not my custom
But rather
Oh it was not nearby either
I heard the shepherd whistle
at having 
neither voice nor other missile
faint
I was never silent
their skulls shattered
Then they scattered
there are still horses and goats
Then he was sorry he had not learnt the art of thinking
all stinking
I had-neither taste nor humour
She could have gone on sorting her 
lentils all night and never achieved her purpose
gas escapes from my fundament on the least pretext
she loved it above all other herbs and 
flowers
But I was 
not made for the great light that devours
He lay 
down on the tiles
Don’t worry about the miles
I stumbled
wakes
Bpi now I shall say my old lesson
too often forgotten
I have never been particularly resolute
but it is not so serious as 
it seems
Of the brief period of 
plentitude between these two extremes
they 
stop to listen to my screams
then 
it speaks of gleams
I shall be back where I started
they took away things when 
they departed
I am sorry I cannot indicate 
more clearly^ how this result was obtained
though they are not chained
There is nothing to be gained
But I 
am there to be pained
they want to be entertained
I mean Sophie
thanks
tanks
these bawling mouths that never 
bawl out of season
but for no good reason
He 
would stand rapt
words falling
at rest or forever moving
My boots became rigid
I 
had so to speak only one leg at my disposal
there was nothing more 
to be squeezed
My soul 
appeased
he

might believe what he pleased
from the old stand where they bore 
false witness
I am neither
Eat your soup
I made to stoop
of the loop
Not to have been a dupe
From this point of view the spot is well chosen
like 
distant laughter
He was highly thought of as a 
bleeder and disjointer of pigs and greatly sought after
She had a parrot
He 
must have belonged to an American sailor
He listened
There were also occasional 
tables
My beard was missing
sweep down and go out hissing
by opening my doors and letting myself be 
devoured
I feel it plunged in me up 10 the elbow
Here is the programme anyhow
then a brief quivering of leaves
I nearly said 
as in a dream
should have living for its 
theme
till I go mad and 
begin to scream
by making 'an effort
of being finished
all things considered
but I confined myself to the following
more likely
all young and slender
I mean when you record circumstances better left unspoken
I must have spoken
but politely
Had there 
then elapsed
far from being full
though no less foreign
They rocked gently
I don’t know to what race he belonged
But impossible situa- 
tions cannot be prolonged
He 
wore white trousers
at each 
fresh inspection it seemed changed
But to suck the stones in the way I have described
Thus was inscribed
we’re leaving
you can’t call that believing
Now with regard to the pockets
all the more so as he would have been capable
Shall I be incapable
not to mention the two cunts into the Bargain
More precisely
there's a god for the damned
But it is merely a passing

weakness
then expounding further
my body could tell between them and seemed even to 
have its likes
then 
suddenly briefly
now on my stomach
So that I was never disappointed
but it was a night of listening
I must try and discover
epicentre of joys
Then I was no longer that sealed jar to which I owed 
my being so well preserved
Hens on the other hand are more stubborn livers and 
some have been observed
stakes long since dead and 
ready for burning
tralatralay pom pom
But that did not 
happen to me often
But in there you have 
to be careful
not willingly
I did not 
penetrate at once
by dint of patience
must 
have been ill-connected with the spider
then wider anil wider
I would have been I think an excellent husband
House and 
garden were fixed
I had moved
I left the shelter of the doorway 
and began levering myself forward

nothing new or strange
so that I too had to change
He must have known he was out of range
of that I was 
all but convinced
But 
on this occasion
my bushes
Draw the curtains
Both
But even 
sipid they would have made no difference
so 
terror-stricken that I was virtually bereft of feeling
I am convinced for example that 
at the present moment it is as bright under my bed as it is under 
the ceiling
not to say of 
consciousness
less 
surprisingly
you merely die of 
pneumonia and your legs none the vvorse for the wetting
my genius for forgetting
all the more so as he had the 
impertinence to come straight to where I was sitting
my right foot
he’ll know what is 
afoot
So 
I will confine myself to the following brief additional remarks
he must have 
been employed to watch over some kind of public works
We met in a rubbish dump
but what is it that presses against my rump
Through the splendours of nature they dragged a paralytic and now 
there’s nothing more to admire it’s my duty to jump
She gave 
me money after each session
I see then I had attributed to myself certain objects no longer 
in my possession
all the 
things that have always been my dream at bottom
I would have preferred it seems to me an orifice 
less arid and roomy
but with all kinds of little many-coloured flowers and 
herbaceous plants
by way of mortification 
certainly
doors opening and shutting
There was no way out of the alley
called Bally
but I had other props
But 
when it falters and when it stops
My knees are enormous
So it was not without 
some trepidation that I inspected the other great planes
Washed on the 
surface only by the rains
you look for 
yourself in the mountains and the plains
I obtained a result
They made a little too much music
some in the shelter of 
the umbrella
Flat on my belly
no 
more nails
there’s a carrot never 
fails
words bellying out my sails
I’ll tell one of Mahood’s old tales
I had stolen from Lousse 
a little silver
I called
from his good collection properly so-called
thrown away because it could no longer 
serve
all spins
my end begins
There is rapture
I described a complete circle
But in the country there is 
another justice
I never escaped
all that is needed is to wander and let wander
but vanish
not really
hale and 
hearty
raise 
their heads
Day is the time for lynching
He kept looking at 
his watch

their elders
sweat and trembling
I wondered
half sleeping
I’ll sec fingers
One day nothing will remain of it but two islands
by an extraordinary hazard
not haphazard
one day suddenly it dawned 
on the former
but dimly
one group in each pocket
my horn and the other things that I have not yet named
So that Moll exclaimed
But nicely posed
He began explaining that the first day the shops had been closed
came and stared
of whom I despaired
urged on* by the cries and laughter of her 
companions
my 
napkin tucked into my collar
but I say my pots
I was always aged
at the gates of their metropolis
though of the same 
family exactly
by using the former exclusively
Here 
obviously two distinct operations were involved
I 
resolved
But I am human
I fancy
he suffers as 
he has always suffered
these giant fronds
they call that bonds
at least unloved
quite plainly and frankly
I wonder 
if he was looking for something in particular
my asthma
but also to innumerable so-called weak points
but there was 
still some play in the hip joints
like the crackling of thorns
at least I think it’s urine
my tiny lawns
I think that all that is false may more readily be reduced
I 
don’t like gloom to lighten
I 
had a certain number of encounters in this forest
but all the same 
I had my little quota
but as clearly as the visibility "permits
cleaned
then sometimes my bed is caught up into the air and 
tossed like a straw by the swirling eddies
But imperatives are a 
little different
here we’d need Latin
But leaves or no leaves I would have 
abandoned erect motion
No 
emotion
at the edge of the ocean
there’s crawling
more and more galling
trunks
then a lamp would be indispensable
They want me 
to lose patience and rush
now it’s 
slush
Don’t push
He was dressed in his heavy
I 
packed and shouldered the two bags
They made use of tlie spoken 
word in much the same way as the guard of a train makes use of 
his flags
hair and rags
He told her to eat and she began to eat the remains of 
the rabbit
Here are your instructions
heedless of the weather outlook
He 
took out and opened his notebook
no battery
Go to the kitchen
I 
hoped to spare my son this misfortune
So I have noticed
Yes papa
I have listened at different hours of the day and night and never 
heard anything suspicious or unusual
licked his finger
Damp
She sat down 
by the window and turned down the wick of the lamp
were 
so disposed as to lead the eyes gently to the camp
Put in your little knapsack
Would 
I not be impelled
But 
Sapo was not expelled
But he’s a very good 
dentist
My son 
had two albums
of singular beauty 
and simplicity
through the railings
I must have missed my 
point of purchase
now that it’s irrevocable
now beacon
but the very idea of fatherhood
these latter naturally abound- 
ing in such a neighbourhood
dead without knowing it to the meaning of one’s instructions 
and incapable of remembering them for more than a few seconds
they are in the plural
They are numerous
their long lamps
Not a word 
of reproach
but in a slightly 
different attitude
give 
us time and we’ll be a multitude
I have no opinion
he might wonder
Like the mother who whistles to prevent

baby’s bladder from bursting
you scarcely 
breathe
at the moment when the tail rises
like a scurf of placenta
bulk
But instead of making the 
junction
Try and be 
more explicit
I was at pains to use this term
I mean Worm
Poor*Worm
you’ll see him squirm
I can think of no other fowl
howl
first murky
I have always 
had great success with my turkeys
I was not 
going to expose myself to thunderbolts which might be fatal
He struggled
same little abortive moustache
They stop reading
hear it receding
I di\it without 
heeding
toiled
coiled
Since in this way I shirked the issue
those that merge
But once in 
motion it is transformed
yep
torn from their melan- 
choly thoughts
I nearly 
wrote my bagpipes
you try and be reasonable
I shall be patient
But having filially found a suitable branch
My possessions are in a corner
I advanced
my birds of which the least is known to 
me and the way all its own it has of singing
I know 
scarcely any better where I am going and what awaits me than the 
night I ".lung to the wicket
But when I was inside them I 
could think of nothing but my son’s raincoat
I straightened myself 
and laid my hand on his shoulder
Big Lambert had 
not a tooth in his head and smoked his cigarettes in a cigarette- 
holder
I know my eyes are open
dear charnel-house 
of renegades
I who am so good at 
topography
all invented
whom I have often made suffer and seldom contented
I mean while floundering through a pon- 
derous chronicle of moribunds in their courses
He did not answer
then he says Murphy
though in terms if necessary veiled
but the question may be asked
I have endured
not curiosity
Ten shillings
You see no difference between second-hand and 
second-hand for preference
my teeth 
clenched
Stretched out in the 
shelter
He wore a coat much too 
heavy for the time of the year and was leaning on a stick so 
massive
but less noble
full face and profile
But I confess I attended but absently to these poor 
figures
such as a 
kick in the arse
Oh I have also been known to fall in- 
voluntarily
not necessarily
so that its light fell full on the intruder
Of her 
salad
said Lady Pedal
Then 
suddenly I threw myself on the playthings
They also taught 
me to count
I thought I 
was turning my stick to the best possible account
Their quarters were cramped
I watched them shine 
brighter and brighter
by means of 
her cunt
But the dog stops at the threshold
He made a 
practice
pa. I’ll practise
ah no But enough of this cursed first person
who knows to what lengths he may be carried
oh not the very latest
But 
I was succumbing to other affections
I benefit by a hiatus in my 
recollections
no erections
bang
but there were three or four levels
poor 
devils
I was of course inadequately covered
But it I very soon recovered
Then parting her jaws and pulling down 
her blobber-lip she discovered
But I did not like proper shelters
I’ll stop 
screaming
He seized me by the jacket
Of course I still have my little fits 
of impatience
not running
Now it is the present I must establish
I call myself an octogenarian
turn to my spirit gone to rack and ruin
far from help
through the agency of his papa and his mama
Oh Adrian
well 
hidden
But let us profit first by this superb sundown
deep down I never doubted
saw myself losing
they’ll stop howling
limp
my stick has gone through the cupboard
I used to blow bubbles
wild and soft
Big Lambert
wrapped in paper
But they did not dare protest
Clapped 
into a tiny sty on the day of its arrival
all unsuspecting
but in a short time 
of washing
but without malice
how can I recognise myself who never made my acquaintance
had to remain in the middle
He was called the Saxon
no sky for their dispersing
there is nothing like examples
then it must be murmurs
wc must have eyelids
My pencil
so fertile in 
incidents and mishaps
I whose every move has always been 
a groping
I’m all 
these flakes
I would have gone on peacefully being 
bored tr howls
Some nice point in semantics
Then Moll sat down on the 
edge of the bed and distributed her hands as follows
Take advantage of the brand-new soul and substantiality to 
abandon
I on whom all dangles
here I am 
in safety
but perhaps it 
appears to him in the dreadful cries of the gulls that evening 
assembles
up to a point
I’ll be still here at All Saints
who always thought I would shrivel and shrivel
Then it will be all over with the Murphys
not realizing
he at the conception
each hand a tuft
x being the width 
of the shoulders in inches
But the rain glued it to the ground and churned it 
up with the earth and grass into a kind of muddy pulp
I never made anyone suffer
but which little by little invaded
I used it as a receptacle
but insufficiently
Oh not yet sufficiently
so that 
its beautiful eyes might be impressed on the celluloid
One 
weakens
then it passes
nor the 
clinking of the forks and glasses
gagged to the gullet
one of the thieves was saved
Then all retreated
I know I am seated
there’s a pretty analysis
These letters did not much vary in form and tenor
So courage
through what 
channels
who never 
answered
I mean in writing
But 
towards the close of this idyll
I could never bear to be 
idle
he began to compose brief rimes of curious structure
sought a means of putting an end to their 
intercourse
who after all is 
only a female
Then I tried him with other 
functions
But this innumerable babble
spread out from the buildings and beat the thickets
so that the sense of 
guilt
But it’s entirely a matter of voices
set parallel to the wheels
he feels
I can understand their annoyance
who knows towards 
what high destiny I am heading
I’ve never left the island
two curves
though this is unimportant
All the rest I renounce
I don’t mind failing
each one to the best of his capacity
I mean when I took myself for Mahood
Then I with- 
drew my adhesion
seemed likely to restore me to my 
point of departure
per- 
haps < had left my leg behind in the Pacific
both of which I 
had succeeded in preserving
but they wer^ agreed 
I had been a fine baby
from the mouths 
of those whom sleep had not yet overcome
we have only to continue
At the end of I know not what eternity
spew it up whole along with the 
rest of the vomit
I may therefore perhaps legiti- 
mately suppose that the one-armed one-legged wayfarer of a 
moment ago ftnd the wedge-headed trunk in which I am now 
marooned are simply two phases of the same carnal envelope
their arms folded
Slough 
off this mortal inertia
like those I have been asking
But what is the right manner
I tou must contribute my little convulsion
she at the nativity
I’ll have my bellyful of 
mammals
% s a circuit
I placed them before their responsibilities
He 
weeps
we’re 
piled* up in heaps
song and dance 
of thanksgiving by victim
but at length
he suffers
Not that it offers the least 
interest
then louder
so as to gather him without fail into 
their midst
look at the daisies
I 
say 1 sec noting
not knowing what answer the master 
wants
I think I must have blackouts
look 
at this photograph
all is painless
till I’m tempted
one ifiustn’t be 
afraid of making a howler
you came too early
you didn’t notice
let us 
try and determine
let 
us be logical
but appearances may sometimes be deceptive
Make 
abundant use of the principle of parsimony
by a natural association of ideas
nor be dextrous
those are good 
moments
I know millions
he is the afflicted
